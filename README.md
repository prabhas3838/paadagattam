# 📌 Paadagattam – Build Phase Submission

## 🧠 Project Summary

**Paadagattam** is a build-phase prototype developed to demonstrate a complete system workflow with a clear architecture, deployable components, and a narrated walkthrough.  
The project emphasizes modular design, clarity of implementation, and ease of evaluation.

This repository includes:
- Source code of the prototype  
- Architecture design  
- Deployment artifacts  
- Documentation and demo references  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a clear and modular system architecture  
- Build a functional prototype  
- Package and deploy the solution for evaluation  
- Provide a voiceover-based explanation of the prototype  
- Share all deliverables via Google Drive as per submission guidelines  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture separating user interaction, application logic, and data management.

### Architecture Flow

User -> Frontend/Client interface ->Backend/Application Logic -> Database/External services


### Architecture Description

- **Frontend / Client**
  - Handles user interactions
  - Communicates with backend APIs

- **Backend**
  - Contains core business logic
  - Processes requests and validations
  - Interacts with database/services

- **Database / Services**
  - Stores persistent data
  - Handles external integrations if required
